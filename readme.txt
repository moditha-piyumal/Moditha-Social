We have a working Social Media Site.
Posts are being Displayed on the Dashboard.
Comments are being Displayed below them.
We can add posts and comments on the Dashboard. 
We can click the users who added comments and go to their profiles. 
We can see the Posts and comments in the Profiles as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we go to the profiles we cannot add comments. (FIX)

---------------------------

The Comments and Posts Section in the Profiles do not look as good as in the Dashboard.
The Posters can be clicked and we can go to their profiles, but, the commenters cannot be clicked. 
There is no chat function.
There is no follow unfollow method.
